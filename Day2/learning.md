## ‚úÖ Progress
- Learned system-level commands (`whoami`, `sudo`, `ps`).  
- Explored important directories (`/sbin`, `/var`, `/lib`, `/tmp`).  
- Practiced file operations (`cat`, `cp`, `rm`).  
- Improved navigation skills with `cd ..`.  
- Used terminal shortcut `Ctrl + P` for command history.

## üöÄ Next Steps
- Learn about `grep`, `find`, `chmod`, and `chown`.  
- Explore more system monitoring commands like `top` and `htop`.  
- Practice shell scripting basics.
